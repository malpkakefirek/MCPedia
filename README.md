# MCPedia

This is a discord bot integrating [the Minecraft wiki](minecraft.wiki) and other useful features to help with playing Minecraft and sharing information on Discord.\
Right now the bot itself isn't publicly available, but I have plans to change that in the future.

## What's happening with the project?
At this point the project is on hold, as replit removed free hosting. Once I got time I will look into free hosting options and cleanup the repo from unnecesseary files
