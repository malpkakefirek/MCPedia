# MCPedia

This is a discord bot integrating [the Minecraft wiki](minecraft.wiki) and other useful features to help with playing Minecraft and sharing information on Discord.\
Right now the bot itself isn't publicly available, but I have plans to change that in the future.

## What's happening with the project?
Bot won't be publicly available for the time being, as I don't a host for it. Once I got time to look into hosting options, I will cleanup the repo from unnecesseary files and hopefully open the bot to the public
